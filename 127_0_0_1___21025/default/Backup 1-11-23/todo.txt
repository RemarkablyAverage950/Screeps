Forecast quantities for tasks
    -check for valid quantities assigning a build task
    -check forecast when assigning refill tasks

implement pathfinding
    -transporters
    -miners
 
check on forecasting withdraw requests - we had a transport creep get stuck trying to withdraw from an empty mining container

Set up long distance harvesting

Set up room security system (turning on safe mode)

double check transport only increased on full mining/mineral container

new autobuild:
    - looks good but needs roads from each container to each container as well - add containers as centers
    - autobuild walls/ramparts
    - set up contigency if buildings get destroyed
    - not seeing any towers - make sure those are getting placed
    - trade upgrader container for mineral container
    - autobuild upgrader link
    - consider placing GCL limits on when to build buildings and tie roadbuilding into these limits
