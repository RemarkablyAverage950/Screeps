    SPAWNING:
    - Set spawn priority for builder to 4.
    - Clamped builder count to <= 4
    - Clamped remote hauler count to <= 2 per outpost.
    - Set max remote miner count to 1.
    - Fixed issue where manageSpawns was creating a more expensive defender than room spawn capacity.
    - Only spawning remote maintainer if rcl >= 4.
    - Changed how conserve energy value is set based on room level and storage being present. 
        Integrated body generating and target counts with multiple role types
    - Now spawning a work/move/carry upgrader if storage and energy in storage < 20k
    - Will not spawn a mineral miner if conserving energy. Resulting from this, hauler is also normal size.
    - Counts towers as + 1000 work needed when generating builder bodies.
