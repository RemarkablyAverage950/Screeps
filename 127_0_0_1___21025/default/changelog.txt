Version 0.1

    SPAWNING:
    - Set spawn priority for builder to 4.
    - Clamped builder count to <= 4
    - Clamped remote hauler count to <= 2 per outpost.
    - Set max remote miner count to 1.
    - Fixed issue where manageSpawns was creating a more expensive defender than room spawn capacity.
    - Only spawning remote maintainer if rcl >= 4.
    - Changed how conserve energy value is set based on room level and storage being present. 
        Integrated body generating and target counts with multiple role types
    - Now spawning a work/move/carry upgrader if storage and energy in storage < 20k
    - Will not spawn a mineral miner if conserving energy. Resulting from this, hauler is also normal size.
    - Counts towers as + 1000 work needed when generating builder bodies.
    - Fixed bug where multiple soldiers were spawning for assault missions.
    - Fixed bug where multiple claimers were spawning for claim missions.

    OUTPOSTS:

        - Fixed bug in finding distance to outpost sources.
        - Calls defender if hostile structure (Invader Core) spawns in room.
        - Now only finding new outposts in rooms that are not occupied (hostiles/reserved/owned)
        - Fixed bug where on memory reset more than max outposts could potentially be added.
        - Will not outpost in rooms that have structures. Instead a dismantle mission will be generated first.
        - Will not spawn remote miner for a source with a full container.
        - Balanced remoteHauler spawning for a room's outposts

    ROLES:

        Dismantler:

            - Handles dismantle missions.
            - Targets a path to controller first.
            - Targets a path to storage second.
            - Targets ramparts ontop of fullest structure third.


        Hauler:

            - Spawns units if more than 2 containers.
            - Units now only withdraw energy from source containers.
            - Units now deliver to spawn containers.
            - Units will try and deliver to stationary builders/upgraders/workers until a storage is present.

        Hub: 

            - Unit now loads and unloads all resources to and from terminal.

        LongHauler:

            - Spawns when there is a dismantle mission and target structures have reachable store stock.
            - Spawns factors in dropped resources.
 
        Remote builder:

            - Units no longer clear assigned room when finished building. 
                Units focus on upgrading controller if no construction tasks available.

        Remote hauler:

            - Units now deliver to spawn containers.
            - Units will try and deliver to stationary builders/upgraders/workers until a storage is present.
            - Units now find more direct path between rooms.

        Reserver:

            - Unit now attacks enemy owned controllers

        Scout:

            - Uses a cheaper algorithm to find next room to move to. Added some randomization to help break out of equal lastScanTimes.

        Defender:

            - Creep now uses ranged attack or heal when no healthy attack parts
            - Now attacks hostile structures.

    MANAGE CREEPS:

        - Withdraw tasks now require there to be at least some of the resource in the withdraw target store.         
        - Adjusted some parameters on withdraw and pickup tasks.
        - Seperated withdraw and pickup task finder by if or if not the task should fill the creeps inventory.
        - Made imporvements on haulers and remote haulers by allowing them to refill parked builders, upgraders, and fillers
        - Fixed some bugs. Set up dedicated dismantler
        - Fixed deliver tasks bug causing creeps to get stuck.

    PATHFINDING:

        - If path is not generated at 2000 ops, searches for path at 4000 ops.
        - If no path is found, task and path are both canceled.
        - No longer detecting hostile construction sites that units can walk over.
        - Fixed multiple bugs
        - Added mechanic for creeps to try and push stationary units out of their way.
        - Re-worked pathfinding to generate better multi-room paths for some units.

        - Adjusted lab placement start search position.
        - Fixed rampart room edge boundry clamping.
        - Fixed bug where outpost roads build orders would not be set when passing through a rampart.
        - Defined inside of base when ramparts placed. Cut out ramparts outside of base.
        - Stamps now place further from exits.
        - Extensions look for spots to snap together in grids, or lock 1 up/down/left/right while still sharing some of a road.

        - Now only placing ramparts on outside containers and links.
