storage.db['rooms.objects'].update({ _id: 'cf030773144fccf' },{ $set: { level: 6 }})

Room Planner:

    [x] Create a function for placing all connecting roads.
        [x] Roads place after all stamps are placed, before ramparts and before additional structures
        [x] Spawn block center to Hub, sources
        [x] Each extension to hub
        [x] Each source and mineral to hub
        [x] Leave labs to hub, let lab stamp handle it.
    
    [x] Try to snap extension blocks to existing extension blocks.
    [x] Keep structures a little further from exits. This can be done by declaring those tiles near exits unavailable initially.
    [] Place towers at closest optimal positions (where filler cannot get range attacked.)

    [x] Fix bug where outpost road does not get placed at a boundry rampart.

    [x] Bug where 2 ramparts did not place on road leading away from center of rampart wall.

    [] Only containers & links near an edge wall and outside base get a rampart
        [x] Outside
        [] Edge wall

    [] Save interior positions in memory for later pathfinding (when hostiles are present)
    
    [x] Have extension blocks imperfectly snap to eathother as well.

    [x] Broken road placement from some ramparts. Unable to place roads on ramparts leading away from wall centers.
        [x] Does not appear to be correctly creating a new tile, or is overwriting existing tile(more likely).

    Extensions:
        [x] Start looking for open spot in direction of spawn at about range 2 from storage
        [x] When placing each block, find all possible snap positions for an existing block. If there are any, snap to the closest one to the storage. 
        [] Place freeform extensions on top, left, right, and bottom of an extension block
            -[0,3],[3,0] etc.

    Low Priority:

    [] Rampart roads should stay inside base area
        - May be able to use minimum cut to generate a costMatrix for area outside of ramparts. 

Pathfinding:

    [] Creeps can/should path all the way to destinations, including in other rooms.
    [] Initial cost matrix does not looks for creeps, enemy or otherwise.
    [] Some units bounce in and out when transitioning between rooms.
    [] Better classification of what rooms are safe to travel through to prevent erratic paths avoiding safe rooms (one hostile structure that is not a tower, etc.)

    getPath: (for creeps)
        [] When generating a path for creeps, avoid stationary creeps in range of 2
        [] Avoid hostile creeps by a range of 4, with +10 costs in range
        [] Creeps (scouts) unable to path to exit due to enemy in way. They just freeze.

    moveCreep:
        [] Scan for hostile creeps and re-gen if in range of 5
        [] Scan path for stationary creeps in next position (including fatigued), regen path if nescessary

    [] Consider pushing creeps blocking a path out of the way.
        [] Can modify park task and disallow the current position.

    

Roles:

    Builder:
        [] Choose most built of a certain structure to build first.

    Defender:
        [] When there are no live parts of a type, disable that type of part.

    Dismantler:
        [x] ScanData looks for rooms with structures, not mine, not my outpost, and then creates mission to send dismantler.
        [x] Dismantler takes down all structures 

    fastFillers:
        [x] Spawn at level 4:

    Hauler:
        [x] Can deposit into spawn containers (if no storage exists)
        [x] Spawn if container count > 2.
        [x] Deposits into spawn containers first, but only if the container can take 50 % of creep load.

    Hub:
        [] Spawn this unit if there are 2 links, and one is the hub link OR if a storage and a terminal is present.
        [x] Set up non-energy resource management.
            [x] Load terminal
            [x] Load storage
        
    Maintainer:
        [x] Seems to only be generating a 1work/1carry/1move creep when no storage present. Some structures are too degraded.

    Remote Hauler:
        [x] Can deposit into spawn containers (if no storage exists)
        [] Fix: When assigned room is under attack, even if they are full they are not delivering to storage.
        [] Unit was ignoring one overflowing source container and trying to pick up crumbs from the closer one.
        [] Should find closest creep or container when looking to deliver without a storage
        [x] Deposits into spawn containers first, but only if the container can take 50% of creep load
        [] Units find fullest container by forecast to pickup from. (only visible outposts)

    Scout:
        [] Fix multiple scouts are targeting the same room due to lastScanTime.
            - Need to target room not assigned to a scout.
        [x] Should use Game.map.findRoute().length instead of r.distance for calculating distance to homeroom.


    RemoteWorker
        [] Continues spawning until room level 2
        [] Harvests
        [] Picks up dropped energy
        [] Withdraws energy
        [] Builds spawn
        [] Upgrades controller if downgrade in < 10k ticks
        When spawn built:
            [] 1. Fills spawn
            [] 2. Builds other structures
            
    
Room Defense:

    [] Spawn defender(s) to handle units if no towers, or if towers cannot damage on their own.

Spawning:

    [x] Only need to spawn a remote maintainer if home room RCL >= 4.
    [x] Spawn multiple scouts if RCL < 8
    [x] Spawning too many soldiers to handle invader core missions.

Outposts:

    [x] Only declare new outpost if the room is not currently reserved by another player.
    [] Do not declare an outpost if room has structures, send dismantler instead.
    [] If taking an outpost from an enemy is uneffective, cancel outpost and asses what is needed before targeting as an outpost again.
    [x] Send defender if an invader core pops up in outpost.
    [x] Still creating too many outposts for only having 1 spawn. This needs to be capped at 3.
    [] Calculate remote haulers required as a whole across all outposts

Expansion Manager:
    
    Implement Mission types:

        [] Invader core no towers
            [] Send single soldier.

        [] Invader core with towers
            [] Assess, most likely send multiple quads

        [] Player room lower level.
            [] Assess

        [] Player room no units.
            [] Soldiers

        [] Other player's outpost

        [] Player room same level.


    Invader Reserved Rooms:
        [] Better classify via ScanData these reserved rooms.
        [] Create more specific type of mission to destroy these invader cores.
        [] Currently generating multiple (too many) assault missions but does not seem to be executing them.

    [x] W7N3 set up an outpost way over in W4N2. There is an issue with range/homeroom assignment.

    Claim Missions:

        [] End claim mission when controller.my and RCL >= 2

    Invade undefended room mission:

        [] Detect and assign this mission if controller is owned but there are no units.
        [] Consider following up with claiming the room for myself.

    Bugs:

        [] ScanRoom data being duplicated in monitoredRooms (MEMORY.rooms[room.name].monitoredRooms)
            - Think this is fixed.
