Room Planner:

    [x] Fix roads leading from ramparts. Sometimes, they place outside of rampart walls. It would be best if they did not go through rampart walls at all.
    
    [] Use structureType priorities for construction site placement.

    [] Place towers at closest optimal positions (where filler cannot get range attacked.)

    [] Only containers & links near an edge wall and outside base get a rampart
        [x] Outside
        [] Edge wall

    [] Save interior positions in memory for later pathfinding (when hostiles are present)


Pathfinding:

    [x] Creeps can/should path all the way to destinations, including in other rooms.
    [x] Initial cost matrix does not looks for creeps, enemy or otherwise.
    [] Some units bounce in and out when transitioning between rooms.
    [x] Better classification of what rooms are safe to travel through to prevent erratic paths avoiding safe rooms (one hostile structure that is not a tower, etc.)

    getPath: (for creeps)
       
        [] Avoid hostile creeps by a range of 4, with +10 costs in range
        [] Creeps (scouts) unable to path to exit due to enemy in way. They just freeze.

    moveCreep:
        [] Scan for hostile creeps and re-gen if in range of 5
        [] Scan path for stationary creeps in next position (including fatigued), regen path if nescessary


    

Roles:


    Hub:
        [] Spawn this unit if there are 2 links, and one is the hub link OR if a storage and a terminal is present.

    Long Hauler:

        [] Look for dropped tombstones
        [] Look for pickup targets when entering a room.

    Remote Hauler:
        [] Fix: When assigned room is under attack, even if they are full they are not delivering to storage.
        [] Units find fullest container by forecast to pickup from. (only visible outposts)


    RemoteWorker

        [] Upgrades controller if downgrade in < 10k ticks
        When spawn built:
            [x] 1. Fills spawn
            [x] 2. Builds other structures
            
    
Room Defense:

    [] Spawn defender(s) to handle units if no towers, or if towers cannot damage on their own.


Outposts:

    [] Rename manageOutposts

    [] If a source is too many steps away, don't mine it. Don't outpost rooms that have no minable sources.

    [] If taking an outpost from an enemy is uneffective, cancel outpost and asses what is needed before targeting as an outpost again.
    [] Calculate remote haulers required as a whole across all outposts

Expansion Manager:

    [] Re-name manageMissions

    Power Bank Missions:

        [] Req RCL: 8
        [] Implement mission type.
        [] Create a squad for this
            [] Roles
                [] Power miner
                [] Healer
        [] Assign long haulers as needed.

MEMORY:

    [] Track some data used by owned rooms
        [] Want to track if we are in energy conservation mode

Lab Manager:

    [] Module
    
    [] Tracks compounds needed from most basic to most advanced.

    [] Seperate compound by body part type

    [] Find central labs

    [] Tracks available compounds for boosting

    [] Sets up creep tasks for creeps to referance if they need work, to fill and unfill labs

Manage Squads:

    [] Handle joining of creeps to squads in memory.

    [] Handle renewing before deployment

    When ready:

        [] Creeps find valid position to meet up in.

        [] Move to target room

        [] Handle specific mission types:
