Room Planner:

    [x] Create a function for placing all connecting roads.
        [x] Roads place after all stamps are placed, before ramparts and before additional structures
        [x] Spawn block center to Hub, sources
        [x] Each extension to hub
        [x] Each source and mineral to hub
        [x] Leave labs to hub, let lab stamp handle it.
        
    [x] Fix bug where outpost road does not get placed at a boundry rampart.

    Low Priority:

    [] Rampart roads should stay inside base area
        - May be able to use minimum cut to generate a costMatrix for area outside of ramparts. 

Pathfinding:

    [] Creeps can/should path all the way to destinations, including in other rooms.
    [] Initial cost matrix does not looks for creeps, enemy or otherwise.
    [] Some units bounce in and out when transitioning between rooms.

    getPath: (for creeps)
        [] When generating a path for creeps, avoid stationary creeps in range of 2
        
        [] Avoid hostile creeps by a range of 4, with +10 costs in range

    moveCreep:
        [] Scan for hostile creeps and re-gen if in range of 5
        [] Scan path for stationary creeps in next position (including fatigued), regen path if nescessary

    

Roles:

    Hauler:
        [] Can deposit into spawn containers (if no storage exists)

    Maintainer:
        [x] Seems to only be generating a 1work/1carry/1move creep when no storage present. Some structures are too degraded.

    Remote Hauler:
        [x] Can deposit into spawn containers (if no storage exists)

    Scout:
        [] Fix multiple scouts are targeting the same room due to lastScanTime.
            - Need to target room not assigned to a scout.

Room Defense:

    [] Spawn defender(s) to handle units if no towers, or if towers cannot damage on their own.

Spawning:

    [x] Only need to spawn a remote maintainer if home room RCL >= 4.

Outposts:

    [x] Only declare new outpost if the room is not currently reserved by another player.
    [] If taking an outpost from an enemy is uneffective, cancel outpost and asses what is needed before targeting as an outpost again.
