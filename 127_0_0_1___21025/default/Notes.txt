When generating a body for a worker, we are not counting the amount of work to be done at each distance.
This means that it averages the work needed for each site at every site.

Fillers not finding a new task when they have no energy.

Need to park fillers when they have no task.

Creeps picking up closest dropped even though these is enough to fill carry capacity at a further drop.
