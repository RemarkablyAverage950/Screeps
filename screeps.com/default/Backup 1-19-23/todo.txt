Set up long distance harvesting
    - Scout creep if no observer

double check transport only increased on full mining/mineral container

new autobuild:
    - Consider breaking up wallbuilding sources into smaller rectangles.
    Observations:


Clear path from dead creeps.

[] Explorers:
    [] Write role.scout.js
        [x] Record unexplored room data.
        [x] Find closest unexplored room.
        [x] Navigate to target room.
        [x] Prevent traveling through 'unsafe to travel' rooms.
        [x] Set some sort of range limit on how far the scout can travel from home
        [] Log scout report, which rooms it targeted. Output report on death.
        [] Re-write search pattern to search closest possible room to homeroom first
        [] Test
    [x] Update spawnCreeps.js
        [x] Determine if an explorer is needed.
            - If there is an observer, there is no need for Explorers
            - Only spawn explorers after RCL 3
        [x] Spawn an explorer.
        [x] Test
    []  write expansionManager.js
        [x] shifts first entered explorer data when neigbors length > 100 (11x11)
        [] Finds attack targets
        [x] finds long distance harvest targets
    [x] Convert scout data to heap memory
        [x] role.scout.js
        [x] expansionManager.js   

Manage Remote harvesting:
    [] Map & store infrasctructure
    [] Create roles
        [] Remote worker
        [] Remote miner
        [] Remote hauler
    [] Task management for remote workers
    [] Spawning remote workers as needed
        [] Remote worker
        [] Remote miner
        [] Remote hauler
