    [] Spawn as Duo 

[] Explorers:
    [] Write role.scout.js

Autobuild:
    [] Towers:

        [] Issue with some walls that midpoint isnt getting mapped to
        [] Towers are too close to some walls
    [] Fix issue where island of spawns are placed away from base
    [] Controller link still being placed near other structures.

    [x] Consider adding even more dynamic extension placements
    [x] Place link and containers at fastFill for level 6

    I'm trying to naively brute-force body combinations for builders. Anybody want to check my work?

    function test(workParts = 1, moveParts = 1, carryParts = 1, distance = 300, workToBeDone = 3000) {
    const carryCapacity = carryParts * 50;
    const buildPower = workParts * 5;
    const trips = Math.ceil(workToBeDone / buildPower / carryCapacity);
    const speed = Math.min(1, moveParts / (workParts + carryParts / 2));
    const travelTime = ((distance * 2) / speed) * trips;
    const workTime = (carryCapacity / buildPower) * trips;

    const time = travelTime + workTime;
    const costPerTick = (workParts * 100 + moveParts * 50 + carryParts * 50) / 1500;

    return [
        costPerTick * time,
        `${workParts}W/${moveParts}M/${carryParts}C: ${time.toFixed(0)} @ ${costPerTick.toFixed(2)}`
    ];
    }

    function permute(i) {
    return [test(i, 1, 1), test(i, i, 1), test(i, 1, i), test(1, i, i), test(i, i + 1, 1), test(1, i + 1, i)];
    }

    const results = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].flatMap(i => permute(i + 1)).reduce((a, b) => (a[0] < b[0] ? a : b));

    console.log(results[1]);


    Results:

    distance: 10 6W/7M/1C: 43 @ 0.67
    distance: 20 6W/7M/1C: 83 @ 0.67
    distance: 30 6W/7M/1C: 123 @ 0.67

    distance: 130 1W/6M/6C: 640 @ 0.47
    distance: 140 1W/6M/6C: 680 @ 0.47
    distance: 150 1W/6M/6C: 720 @ 0.47
    distance: 160 1W/6M/6C: 760 @ 0.47
    distance: 170 1W/6M/6C: 800 @ 0.47
    distance: 180 1W/6M/6C: 840 @ 0.47
    distance: 190 1W/6M/6C: 880 @ 0.47
    that's optimizing for (minion cost per tick * build time) at varying distances


Tasks:

known bugs:
    [] Creeps in W37S1 try and path through terrain walls. Add check for this
    [] Remote pathfinding:
        [] Remote creeps running into/through enemy creep 
        [] Remote workers taking the long way when a faster path is available.
        [] Remote haulers (possibly all remotes or all creeps) re-finding a path every turn.
    scouting:
        [] Scout from W37N1 fails to path to left room ?
            [] duplicate
            [] Scouts mark rooms as hostile and regular workers dont move to room because rooms never get marked as not hostile. 

    prototypes:
        [] source.assignedCreeps().length < source.maxCreeps() not working with 1 miner assigned.
To update controller level:
storage.db['rooms.objects'].update({ _id: '5fe40774411d32f' },{ $set: { level: 3 }})
