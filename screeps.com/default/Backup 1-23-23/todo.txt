Forecast quantities for tasks
 
Set up long distance harvesting
    - Scout creep if no observer

double check transport only increased on full mining/mineral container

new autobuild:
    - Consider breaking up wallbuilding sources into smaller rectangles.
    Observations:


Clear path from dead creeps.

Set up links

Set up fastFill
    -spawn creeps
    -set up tasks

Set up hubManager(creep)
    -spawn creep
    -set up tasks



Set up soldier/healer duos

[] Explorers:
    [] Write role.scout.js
        [x] Record unexplored room data.
        [x] Find closest unexplored room.
        [x] Navigate to target room.
        [x] Prevent traveling through 'unsafe to travel' rooms.
        [x] Set some sort of range limit on how far the scout can travel from home
        [] Log scout report, which rooms it targeted. Output report on death.
        [x] Re-write search pattern to search nearest room closest to homeroom first
        [] Test
    [x] Update spawnCreeps.js
        [x] Determine if an explorer is needed.
            - If there is an observer, there is no need for Explorers
            - Only spawn explorers after RCL 3
        [x] Spawn an explorer.
        [x] Test
    []  write expansionManager.js
        [x] shifts first entered explorer data when neigbors length > 100 (11x11)
        [] Finds attack targets
        [x] finds long distance harvest targets
    [x] Convert scout data to heap memory
        [x] role.scout.js
        [x] expansionManager.js   

Manage Remote harvesting:
    [x] Map & store infrasctructure
    [] Create roles
        [] Remote worker
            [x] Move to target room
            [x] Harvest mineral
            [x] Build construction site
            [] Repair road
            [] Find new target when room done.
        [] Remote miner
            [] Move to target room
            [] Find target
            [] harvest target
        [] Remote hauler
            [] Move to target room
            [] Pickup minerals
                [] Tombstones
                [] Dropped
                [] Container
    [] Task management for remote workers

    [] Spawning remote workers as needed
        [x] Remote worker
        [] Remote miner
            [] Count container tiles in remote outposts
        [] Remote hauler

[] Integrate updating outpost tiles tile.placed in autobuild
    [] Test

[] All miners get a position target and a harvest target - harvest target gets checked when assigning task to miner
    [] Test
known bugs:
    Respawned creeps re-using old path
