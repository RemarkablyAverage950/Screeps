    I'm trying to naively brute-force body combinations for builders. Anybody want to check my work?

    function test(workParts = 1, moveParts = 1, carryParts = 1, distance = 300, workToBeDone = 3000) {
    const carryCapacity = carryParts * 50;
    const buildPower = workParts * 5;
    const trips = Math.ceil(workToBeDone / buildPower / carryCapacity);
    const speed = Math.min(1, moveParts / (workParts + carryParts / 2));
    const travelTime = ((distance * 2) / speed) * trips;
    const workTime = (carryCapacity / buildPower) * trips;

    const time = travelTime + workTime;
    const costPerTick = (workParts * 100 + moveParts * 50 + carryParts * 50) / 1500;

    return [
        costPerTick * time,
        `${workParts}W/${moveParts}M/${carryParts}C: ${time.toFixed(0)} @ ${costPerTick.toFixed(2)}`
    ];
    }

    function permute(i) {
    return [test(i, 1, 1), test(i, i, 1), test(i, 1, i), test(1, i, i), test(i, i + 1, 1), test(1, i + 1, i)];
    }

    const results = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].flatMap(i => permute(i + 1)).reduce((a, b) => (a[0] < b[0] ? a : b));

    console.log(results[1]);


    Results:

    distance: 10 6W/7M/1C: 43 @ 0.67
    distance: 20 6W/7M/1C: 83 @ 0.67
    distance: 30 6W/7M/1C: 123 @ 0.67
    distance: 40 6W/7M/1C: 163 @ 0.67
    distance: 50 6W/7M/1C: 203 @ 0.67
    distance: 60 1W/4M/4C: 480 @ 0.33
    distance: 70 1W/4M/4C: 540 @ 0.33

    distance: 100 1W/4M/4C: 720 @ 0.33
    distance: 110 1W/4M/4C: 780 @ 0.33
    distance: 120 1W/6M/6C: 600 @ 0.47
    distance: 130 1W/6M/6C: 640 @ 0.47
    distance: 140 1W/6M/6C: 680 @ 0.47
    distance: 150 1W/6M/6C: 720 @ 0.47
    distance: 160 1W/6M/6C: 760 @ 0.47
    distance: 170 1W/6M/6C: 800 @ 0.47
    distance: 180 1W/6M/6C: 840 @ 0.47
    distance: 190 1W/6M/6C: 880 @ 0.47
    that's optimizing for (minion cost per tick * build time) at varying distances


Tasks:

known bugs:
    [] Creeps in W37S1 try and path through terrain walls. Add check for this
    [] Soldier keeps standing on edge of W38S3 blocking entrance path
    [x] W37S2 - two containers near one source. Causing problem.
    [] Remote miners find new target in other room on reset.
        [] Have them search the room they are in for the closest target first.
    [x] remote haulers not keeping their target
    [] Remote pathfinding - remote hauler running into/through enemy creep   
    [] Remote workers standing on containers while they repair

To update controller level:
storage.db['rooms.objects'].update({ _id: '5fe40774411d32f' },{ $set: { level: 3 }})
